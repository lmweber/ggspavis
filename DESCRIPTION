Title: Visualization functions for spatially resolved transcriptomics data
Description: Visualization functions for spatially resolved transcriptomics 
    datasets stored in SpatialExperiment format. Includes functions to create 
    several types of plots for data from from spot-based (e.g. 10x Genomics 
    Visium) and molecule-based (e.g. seqFISH) technological platforms.
